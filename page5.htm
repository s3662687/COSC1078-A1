<h2><u style="border-bottom: 1px solid black; padding: 0 0 0px;">Minecraft MOD</u></h2>
<h5>What is it?<h5>
<p>Minecraft is popular multi-platform video game of the sandbox genre and was originally made using a variation of Java programming lanaguages. It's well-known for having a massive modding community with
  many community tools made for modding the game and the developer encouraging mods as well. Modding simply means modification, this means
  modifying the games contents/assets. It's now currently wriiten in a dual java/C++ lanaguage.</p>
<h5>Motivation:</h5>
<p>Minecraft is game with a big modding community and therefore lots of tools for modding making
  it somewhat beginner friendly for newcomers of the modding community. I'm interested in making
  a mod for minecraft simply because i've been playing the game since beta and since i have some interest
  in video game developement this will give me some experience.</p>
<h5>Description:</h5>
<p>The mod i'm thinking of doing are stuff like adding new weapons, resources and maybe enviroment. The game doesn't have many weapon to choose from, mostly sword or bow, <body>
  having more variety in weapons can allow people to experiment with different playstyles. As someone who spent most the time exploring and building
  having new resources such as new metals and enviroments would simply make the experience much more fun. </p>
<br>
<h5>Problems:</h5>
<p>Bugs and glitches are very liekly to happen so frequent testing is neccesary. Minecraft is also a game that is relatively active
as it gets patches every few months so keeping the mod up to date to be compatitble is also needed(although the game does allow player to play older versions).
Crashes will probably occur as well so testing for those are needed. By adding new things to the game it might make more CPU intensive
making less accessible to those on lower-end/older computers.</p>
<br>
<h5>Tools and skills</h5>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Advance knowledge of Java and C++ programming lanaguage and their IDE.</li>
  <li> Maybe knowledge in Object-oriented programming.</li>
  <li> Knowledge of Minecraft.</li>
  <li> Designing texture and animations.</li>
  <li> Basic level sound design e.g. the sound of weapon hitting enemies.</li>
  <li> A average PC </li>
  <li> Community tools such as Minecraft Forge</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h5>Outcomes</h5>
<p>A functional mod in for minecraft that add new stuff into the game</p>
