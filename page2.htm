<h2><u style="border-bottom: 1px solid black; padding: 0 0 0px;">Interest in IT</u></h2>
<p>My interested in IT, in particular the software side of IT, is heavily infuence by video games. I started playing video games at a young age of 6, this developed into
  abit of an addiction which eventually got me interested in video game developement. In high school, i did subjects like robotics and basic programming for 2-D computer games, the lets us
  to play around with the codes and test out of student's game, i ended really enjoying these subjects which further increase my interest.</p>

<h2><u> RMIT </u></h2>
<p>I chose to study at RMIT because it was easy to for me to travel to by public transport as i live close to a train station. Another reason i chose to study was because of it reputation
  as one of the better universities in Melbourne. I ended continuing my study here because of it's location and the amount resources
  they provide to the students. As for my expectation of this course, A good balance between teaching and experimenting with hardware and software.</p>
