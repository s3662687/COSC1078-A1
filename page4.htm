<h2><u style="border-bottom: 1px solid black; padding: 0 0 0px;">Myer Briggs Type Test</u></h2>

<br>
<p>Based on this result i'm a virtusuo type. Virtusuo are the tinker prefering to explore with their hands and eyes, they are
  quite curious and rational, also they are spontaneous and enjoy variety. In a work enviroment, excitement and unpredictabliy
  is their top priority. They can't be force to do a task and are more suited to a relax and open enviroment and work well with people
  who are relax and easy-going. Communication can be an issue as they are not naturally emotional or empatheic, in fact they're the opposite,
  logical and blunt which can create misunderstandings, they also very reserved and tend to work well alone or in small groups. As they prefer variety in their job they're arent great with long-term commitments.
<br>
I consider this a very accurate description of me. Communication is my biggest issue when
working in a team as i'm a reserved person who prefer to be in the background and so i don't talk too much.
I'm a easy-going person which can be an issue with teammates as i tend to not to take anything too seroiusly and work at my own pace.
Due to all of this i will probably work well with people who are also easy-going but clash with those who are very serious or controlling.
I would probably be fine with working in a small but diverse group as a diverse group can produce interesting ideas.

<h2><u>Learning style</u></h2>
<center><image src="images/Online/Learning style.jpg"  style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius: 10px;"></center>
<br>
<p>My preferred learning style is a mix of tactile and visual meaning that i learn better with pictures and physical interaction when compared to auditory learning. Things likely
  diagrams, videos, demostrations or simply just figuring things out through trial and error would be more suited to my learning style.
  This means that i'm probably more suited for tasks that requires physical interaction or research. I will probably better with people of similar style
  and when having team meetings drawing or diagrams woul help too.

<h2><u>Big 5 personality traits</u></h2>
<center><image src="images/Online/Big five personality traits.jpg" style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius: 10px;"></center>
<br>
<p>Based on this my Openness, Agreeableness and Neuroticism is consider high but my Extraversion and and Conscientious are low.
<ul>
  <li>Openness: I am open to new challenges or ideas and don't mind change.</li>
  <li>Conscientous: I don't like having a structured planned/schedule and very disorganized, it also means i'm
    good at procrastinating regardless of how important the task is.</li>
  <li>Extraversion: I prefer solitude and get exhausted when having to deal with alot of people and have difficulties in starting and
    maintaining converstaions.</li>
  <li>Agreeableness: I willing to work with other people and that i do care about the people i work with and dislike using other people
    to get what i want.</li>
  <li>Neuroticism: I get stress easily and have trouble dealing with it and that my emotions can change very quickly</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Due to this i much more suited at doing many small tasks then doing a single big task. As i get stress easily and procrastinate quite often
  i more likely to not complete huge task whereas i would likely to complete many many small tasks. If ever to do big task though i would break
  it down to smaller tasks to be able to do it. I probably won't work well with pushy and controlling type people as well as seroius type people.</p>
